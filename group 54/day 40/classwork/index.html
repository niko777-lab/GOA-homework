                    <h3>1950s - Assembly Language</h3>
                    <p>Assembly languages were the first form of programming languages used in early computers. These low-level languages directly corresponded to the machine code, which was hard for humans to understand. Assembly allowed programmers to write human-readable instructions that could be translated into machine code.</p>

                    <h3>1960s - COBOL and FORTRAN</h3>
                    <p>COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) was designed for business applications, and FORTRAN (Formula Translation) for scientific computing. Both languages played a key role in expanding the scope of computer usage, making it accessible to industries like finance and engineering.</p>

                    <h3>1980s - C++ and Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
                    <p>C++ introduced the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP), which allows developers to structure programs by organizing data and functions into objects. This paradigm has been adopted by many programming languages, including Java, C#, and Python, making software development more efficient and maintainable.</p>

                    <h3>1990s - Java and Web Development</h3>
                    <p>Java, with its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy, was one of the first languages to focus on platform independence. The rise of the internet also brought JavaScript, a scripting language that became integral to modern web development, enabling interactive websites and applications.</p>
